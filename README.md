# Flask-MongoDB Web App

The title of your app: Ishar's Recipe app

A simple description of your app:
This app was designed to obtain and store user submitted recipes to the database, store them, and allow for editing and retreivel (ie CRUD) operations. I edited the HTML code to add more aesthetics.

 I tried to get the app running, kept getting a 500 error and when I tried debugging, it says the app doesnt recognize the dotenv module, not sure if there is a pip error on the server itself but I can't find a way to fix it, I sent the .env file i used for the web server in discord
